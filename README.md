**Geometric Escape**

This Unity project was created by Alisona Le and Riddhi Lamba in February 2024. It is a 3D game that allows users to move through an environment and fight randomly spawning enemies which follow the player and add clones of themselves and their children to the game overtime.

Please watch the "Geometric Escape.mp4" to see a demo of the game or check out the code files in the "GeometricEscape" directory.
